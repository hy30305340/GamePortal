The database we have come to build, is a game store database. It is made for the gamer in us. With a wide variety of games, for a various amounts of consoles those games apply to, such as XBOX, PC or PlayStation, and a copious amount of genres that these games fall into, whether it be a simulation game, sport game, or even a strategic game; these games may apply to all the gamers, everywhere. This database is designed for a customer to sign up with his or her’s unique username, unique email address followed by a password and other attributes. Admin is one who oversees all the actions being taken. Example being, an administrator may be able to add or remove a game, and also add or remove a customer. Once a customer purchases a game, they will automatically be charged the price of the product they desired to have – game, accessory, or console. The user is required to sign up for an account. The information the administrators need is the customer’s name, both first and last, an address, which provides a street name, number, city, state and zip code, a unique email address is also needed as well as a unique account username. Once user is signed up, he/she may log in and will not have to sign up any more due to the customer’s information is stored in the game store database. This database is designed by 8 tables: customer, orders, items_ordered, product, admin, game, console, and accessory.
