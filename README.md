GAME_PORTAL 

Anthony, Jingyu & Salman
  The database we have come to build, is a game store database. It is made for the gamer
in us. With a wide variety of games, for a various amounts of consoles those games apply to,
such as XBOX, PC or PlayStation, and a copious amount of genres that these games fall into,
whether it be a simulation game, sport game, or even a strategic game, these games may apply
to all the gamers, everywhere. The initial database is designed by 8 tables: customer,
customer_order, customer_purchase, product, product_types, games, console, and
accessories.
  The user is required to sign up for an account. The information the administrators need
are the customer’s name, both first and last, an address, which provides a street name, number,
city, state and zip code, an email address is also needed as well as a unique identifier account
username. Once user is signed up, he/she may log in and will not have to sign up any more due
to the customer’s information is stored in the game store database.
The types of queries we would use are create, read, update and delete. We need to
create new roles for the games and customers in order to fulfill a customer’s needs and wants.
We need to read in order to identify a customer and if a customer is in our database or not. We
need to update so we can make modifications so our customers are provided with the most
current service. Lastly, we need to delete in order to remove customer accounts, and even
games from the administrator side and also, the customer's side.
The referential integrity constraints would be used in a wide range of tables. For
instance, the table “product_types” would have a foreign key that would refer to the primary key
in the “product” table. Another example would be how for each games in the table “games”, a
foreign key “console_type” would refer to the unique identifier in the table “console” listed as
“type”.
  The search for a game can be made faster for the convenience of the customer. We can
make an index that list the game’s name for when the customer searches for that specific game,
the name of that game will appear, as well as the details that game consist of.
We plan to assign different tasks that will help the team grow and work cohesively as a
unit. We plan to give each person a third amount of the work so all will be equal and that all
members of the group have done their equal part of the project. Throughout our group we have
come to an agreement that Salman will create the ERD and the relational model and will be
done November 4th, Friday. Anthony will create the database and create the tables of the
database, which will be done by November 7th, Monday. Jingyu will connect those tables that
Anthony has provided which will be due on November 11th, Friday. Next, Salman will make
login/sign up form for the website, which will be due on November 14th, Monday. Next, Anthony
will create the search about the names of games which will be due on, November 18th, Friday.
On November 21st, Monday and November 28th, Monday, we will check user/administration
coding are on the path to complete our final draft. On December 2nd, Friday, we will be
wrapping up final paper and talk about how we will present our database. On December 5th, we
will be done with our project.
  We have also come to agree that on every Monday and Friday we will meet in order to
stay on task with all our assignments that we have been provided. This time works best for the
group and works best in order to succeed in our game store database.
